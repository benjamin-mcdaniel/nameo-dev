1. Homepage: The Hero Experience

Headline: Find your next product name or persona easily. Sub-headline: The internet is crowded, but your identity doesn’t have to be. Nameo.dev scans the social, community, and creator landscapes instantly to find where your brand can actually live. Stop hitting dead ends and start building your presence on a foundation that’s actually available.

The Narrative Hook: Most naming tools stop at domain names, but a modern brand is born on TikTok, YouTube, and X. We’ve built a naming companion that looks at the "Everywhere Identity." Whether you are a solo founder launching a SaaS or a creator building a new persona, we provide a single source of truth for your name’s availability across the entire digital frontier.
2. Features & Search Logic

The Unified Search Engine: When you enter a name into our search bar, we don't just check for a 200 OK status. Our engine handles the "normalization" of your idea. It automatically checks how your name looks with or without underscores, handles platform-specific character limits, and filters out "zombie accounts" that might be suspended or inactive.

Intelligent Iteration: If your first choice is taken, we don't just show a red "X." Our system suggests high-quality alternatives that maintain your brand's rhythm and feel. We help you pivot from a taken name to a viable one by suggesting prefixes, suffixes, and creative spelling variations that are currently unclaimed across our core platforms.
3. Sales Page: Choosing Your Tier

The Philosophy of Nameo Pricing: We believe that everyone should be able to check if their dream name is available on the major social networks. That’s why our Basic Platform Search is included for all users at no cost. This covers the "Social Core"—platforms like X, Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube—giving you the immediate feedback you need to start brainstorming.

The Pro Advantage (Advanced Tier): For the power user, the founder, or the agency, we offer Advanced Checks. This tier is designed for those who need more than just a social handle. It includes deep-dives into domain TLDs, App Store conflicts for iOS and Android, and preliminary trademark signals. When the stakes are higher and you are preparing to register a business or spend money on branding, the Advanced Tier provides the comprehensive data you need to avoid expensive naming mistakes later.
4. Help Page & Terms of Service

The "Not a Lawyer" Disclaimer: While Nameo.dev provides data on trademarks and business name conflicts in our Advanced Tier, we are a discovery tool, not a legal service. Our results should be used as a "first-pass" signal. We strongly recommend consulting with a trademark attorney before making significant financial commitments to a name. We provide the map; you should still hire a guide for the legal terrain.

Our Privacy Commitment: Your name ideas are your intellectual property. We have a strict policy against "front-running" or selling your search data to domain squatters. Your search history is stored securely to help you sync your progress across devices, but it is never shared, sold, or used to register names before you can. We are here to help you find your name, not take it.
5. Status & Transparency

Real-Time Reliability: We maintain a live status dashboard because we believe in transparency. If a specific platform like Instagram or TikTok updates their site and our "check" logic needs a tweak, we show you that status immediately. You will always know if a "Taken" or "Available" status is based on live, verified data or if a platform’s connection is currently being serviced by our engineering team.
